# Engineering Portfolio – Gianluigi Riccardi

**EHS • RAMS • Industrial Reliability • Predictive Engineering**

This repository is not a traditional CV.  
It is a **technical portfolio** designed to show **how I think, how I engineer risk, and how I prevent failures** in safety-critical and industrial environments.

---

## Who I Am
Industrial Engineering Manager with **17+ years of experience** in Oil & Gas and critical industrial assets.  
I work at the intersection of **Safety, Reliability, RAMS and Predictive Maintenance**, focusing on **system-level risk reduction and operational continuity**.

My approach is simple:
> *If a failure can be anticipated, it should never happen.*

---

## What I Do
- Engineer **risk out of the system**, not just compliance into procedures
- Apply **RAMS principles** to real industrial assets
- Design **predictive and preventive strategies** based on data and physics
- Support critical operations where **failure is not an option**

---

## Core Competencies
- **Reliability & RAMS**: MTBF, MTTR, Weibull, FMEA/FMECA, Hazard Log, RCA, RCM  
- **Predictive Maintenance**: vibration analysis (FFT, envelope), early fault detection  
- **EHS & Process Safety**: ATEX, confined spaces, LOTO, permit to work, LPS  
- **Critical Operations**: complex lifting, stability analysis, operational risk  
- **Digital Engineering**: MATLAB, Simulink, data-driven automation, technical reporting  

---

## Selected Engineering Projects
Each project is documented with a **clear engineering objective**, assumptions, methods and outcomes.

- **SimuLift**  
  Digital twin (MATLAB/Simulink) for preventive risk assessment in critical lifting operations

- **ReliaVib**  
  Mobile vibration monitoring concept for early fault detection and reliability improvement

- **Original Maintenance Index (OMI)**  
  Predictive vibration-based health indicator for early anomaly detection

- **Intelligent Task Manager**  
  Automated maintenance and EHS planning with traceability and reporting

---

## Engineering Philosophy
- Safety is a **system property**, not a checklist  
- Reliability is built **before** commissioning  
- Data without context is noise  
- Prevention always costs less than recovery

---

## Background
- Oil & Gas, regulated and high-risk environments  
- Complex plants: pipelines, VRU, firefighting systems, wastewater treatment  
- Critical operations and lifting supervision  
- Loss Prevention System (ExxonMobil standard)
