# Engineering Portfolio – Gianluigi Riccardi

## Safety • Reliability • RAMS • AI for Industrial Systems

This repository is not a traditional CV.  
It is a **technical portfolio** showing how I design, assess and improve **critical industrial systems**, combining:

- maintenance coordination  
- RAMS engineering  
- predictive maintenance  
- AI and data-driven methods  

---

## Who I Am

Industrial Engineering professional with **17+ years of experience in Oil & Gas and critical assets**.

I work at the intersection of:

- Maintenance coordination and plant operations  
- Reliability, RAMS and asset integrity  
- HSE and operational risk  
- AI and digital engineering for predictive maintenance  

My philosophy is simple:

> If a failure can be anticipated, it should not happen.

---

## What I Do

- Improve **reliability and availability** of complex systems  
- Apply **RAMS methods** (MTBF, MTTR, FMEA/FMECA, Weibull) to real assets  
- Design **predictive maintenance** strategies using vibration analysis and ML  
- Support **safety-critical operations** where failure is not an option  
- Build digital tools in **MATLAB/Simulink and Python** for engineering workflows  

---

## Core Competencies

- **Maintenance & Operations**
  - maintenance coordination, planning, backlog prioritization
  - risk-based maintenance strategies

- **Reliability & RAMS**
  - MTBF, MTTR, Weibull, FMEA/FMECA, RCA, hazard log
  - availability and lifecycle modelling

- **Predictive Maintenance**
  - vibration analysis (FFT, envelope, trends)
  - early fault detection on rotating equipment

- **HSE & Process Safety**
  - ATEX, confined spaces, LOTO, permit to work
  - Loss Prevention System (ExxonMobil framework)

- **AI and Digital Engineering**
  - MATLAB, Simulink, Python
  - digital twins and simulation models
  - data-driven decision making

---

## Selected Engineering Projects

Each project includes objectives, assumptions, methods and results.

- **SimuLift**  
  Digital twin (MATLAB/Simulink) for risk assessment in critical lifting operations

- **ReliaVib**  
  Mobile vibration monitoring concept for rotating equipment

- **Original Maintenance Index (OMI)**  
  Vibration-based machine health indicator for early anomaly detection

- **Intelligent Task Manager**  
  Automated maintenance and EHS planning with traceability and reporting

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- Safety is a **system property**, not only compliance  
- Reliability is designed **before** commissioning  
- Data without engineering context is noise  
- Prevention costs less than recovery  
- AI is valuable only when **grounded in physics and plant reality**

---
